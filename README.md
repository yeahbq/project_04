### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure you review your project proposal with an instructor so you can make sure it's **something that represents the breadth of your learning**, and make sure it's **something that looks nice**!

---

### Project Objectives

- Write code you want people to read, code that you're proud of and want to show off
- Build something nice and small (not a sprawling mess, but a real MVP)
- Build something with potential to grow (so that you can continue adding features to it after the course)
- Manage your time and emotions well (remember: this is a test-run for your life post-course)

### Technical Requirements

Your app should:

* **Be a full-stack application** with well-styled views on the front-end supported with data and functionality from your own backend.
* **Have an interactive front-end** resulting in a great UX - sounds like a great use case for a SPA.
* **Be relatively comprehensive**. For example:
  * CRUD multiple related data models.
  * Consume a third-party API.
  * Implement authentication and authorization. Consider implementing an admin feature or two.
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** prioritized to help guide you.
* **Be deployed online** so that it's publicly accessible.

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working, full-stack application**, hosted somewhere on the internet (Heroku is fine).
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
    * A table of your **routes** with their **auth** requirements.
* A **Trello board** that contains:
    * Your **user stories** organized in the appropriate list (Ice Box, Current/MVP and Completed), moving from left to right.
    * Your **wireframes** – sketches of the major parts of your UI in your application.
    * Your **EDM** diagramming your models and their relationships.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Decide on your base technology stack**.  Options include:
  * Single-page Apps (SPAs)
    * **MEA/RN Stack**: Use Node, Express, MongoDB, AngularJS or React
    * **RAP Stack**:  If you enjoyed the conventions of Rails and are struggling with the Wild Wild West factor of Node/Express/MongoDB, consider using Rails and Postgres instead.
  * Traditional Roundtrip Apps
    * Use Node/Express/MongoDB with ejs server-side templates
    * Use Rails
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build APIs for your data entities (resources) that are RESTful**.
* **Be consistent** with your code style.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** There is no excuse for non-perfect indentation. Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code** where it makes sense. Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function?
* When you have complex application logic, **write pseudocode before you write actual code**. Thinking through the logic of something in plain English helps.
